# Dotfiles 🌍

A collection of my various dotfiles. Most of the bash scripts I have is based on [this](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) from [Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish). ♥️


### Linking


- `csrutil disable` in bootmode (Hold Cmd+R on startup, navigate to rootshell) (Optional when symlinking `/usr/bin`)

- `cp /usr/local/<script>`

## gitconfig 📈

I'm using Git with GPG (RSA 4096 bit encryption), for a walkthrough on how it is done, [this is the place](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits/).

## bash profile files 📊

Most of these are written by Paul, so I can't take any credit for them. I've customized my terminal to make it look esthetic from my point of view.

## perf.sh 🔥

Benchmarks a node application using v8 compile cache versus not using it, tested to measure v8 + std/esm modules

## regression.sh 🚀

Used to search and stop test suites running in infinite trying to find a regression bug or for smoketests for a specific error message.

# hexdumpi.sh ☄️

Used for util in my [OS](https://github.com/uit-inf-2201-s19/uit-inf-2201-s19.github.io) course to get diffs of boot sectors in RAM in byteformat.

# curl-files.sh 🤯

Does a curl of a base url together with names of files supplied as a path to a text file and downloads the files


# imagesnap.sh

Takes snapshot when mac wakes up, install through `brew install sleepwatcher` and run launch utils after that. 

# OpenSSL (/cert/*.sh)

Bypasses issue with self-signed certificates in Chrome and Safari, heavily copy pasta from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7580508/getting-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-localhost-certificate/43666288#43666288) but I like my scripts stacked one place, all attribution goes to author there.

##### change pwd

`cd cert`
##### create a root authority cert
`./cert/create_root_cert_and_key.sh`

##### create a wildcard cert for mysite.com
`./cert/create_certificate_for_domain.sh mysite.com`

##### or create a cert for www.mysite.com, no wildcards
`./cert/create_certificate_for_domain.sh www.mysite.com www.mysite.com`
