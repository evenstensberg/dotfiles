A collection of my various dotfiles.


### Linking

## gitconfig üìà

I'm using Git with GPG (RSA 4096 bit encryption), for a walkthrough on how it is done, [this is the place](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits/).

## bash profile files üìä

Most of these are written by Paul, so I can't take any credit for them. I've customized my terminal to make it look esthetic from my point of view.

# OpenSSL (/cert/*.sh)

Bypasses issue with self-signed certificates in Chrome and Safari, heavily copy pasta from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7580508/getting-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-localhost-certificate/43666288#43666288) but I like my scripts stacked one place, all attribution goes to author there.

##### change pwd

`cd cert`
##### create a root authority cert
`./cert/create_root_cert_and_key.sh`

##### create a wildcard cert for mysite.com
`./cert/create_certificate_for_domain.sh mysite.com`

##### or create a cert for www.mysite.com, no wildcards
`./cert/create_certificate_for_domain.sh www.mysite.com www.mysite.com`
